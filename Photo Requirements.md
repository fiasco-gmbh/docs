# Photo Requirements

For our services to work reliably we require the photos you send us to meet or exceed certain
criteria. The following list shows our basic rule set for photos:

  - Photos should depict normal passenger cars as defined by regulation (EU) 2018/858, more specifically:
    - Classes `M1` and `M1G` without platform types `SA`, `SB`, `SC`, `SD`, `SG`, and `SH`.
    - Class `N1` without the platform types `BA`, `BC`, `BD`, `BE`, `SB`, `SG`, `SM`, `SF`, `BCSL`, and `BX`.
    - Cars must be younger than 20 to 25 years.
  - Photos should be pre-classified (if possible) using the subject field to discern between photos showing
    actual damages and other photos (e.g. general photos of the car or paperwork).
  - The subject of the photos should be clean (not wet, dirty, glossy, ...) and the car and damages should
    be clearly visible.
  - Reflections must be kept to a minimum.
  - The car should not be constricted. We recommend at least 3m of free distance around the car.
  - There should be multiple (ideally four) photos for each damage, taken from different angles
    (slightly tilted left/right/up/down).
  - The resolution of each photo should at least be 1500px Ã— 1500px.
  - Photos should be oriented in the correct way or include EXIF data to correctly determine the orientation.
  - A damaged part must be completely visible on at least one photo.
  - Photos should be taken using daylight or in a well-lit area. Do not focus a light directly on a damaged
    area to avoid reflections and overexposure.
  - Photos should not be manually edited. Markings like lines, arrows, circles, etc. should not be added.
  - Photos should not contain hands / fingers to show or highlight something.
  - Photos should not contain deflectometry patterns (horizontal or vertical stripes).
  - Photos should not contain hail damage.
  - Re-encoding files (e.g. JPEG to JPEG or JPEG to PNG) should be avoided.
  - Quality settings of file encoders (e.g. JPEG or PNG export) should be set to 90% or higher.
