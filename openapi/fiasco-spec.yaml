  description: |-
    We are providing several API endpoints for external partners which are described in this documentation.
    All endpoints are using a REST-like interface, meaning they are called via HTTP with a specific payload
    (described separately for each endpoint, don't forget to set the Content-Type header accordingly) and
    respond with an `application/json` payload.

  - name: Calculation Requests
    description: |-
      Calculation requests are requests to calculate the costs of a repair based on the provided data.
      The calculation is done asynchronously and the results are delivered via webhook.
  - name: Express Links
    description: |-
      Express links are links towards a web app that collects information from an end user,
      sends this data to our cloud, and optionally triggers a calculation.
  - name: Calculations
    description: |-
      Calculations are the results of either a calculation request or an express link request.
      They can be sent to an AudaNet recipient or via email to a specified recipient.

          required if the field `doCalculation` is true.

          The fields in the `VehicleData` schema can be used to pre-fill data for the end user (e.g. vehicle information).
